📚 Study Progress Summary 


✅ 5 May 2025
Set up the GitHub repository for tracking my study progress.
Created and committed the initial version of learning-log.md.
Began logging insights from the MITx 6.00.1x Computer Science course.
Covered foundational topics including:
What is an algorithm vs a program
Basic concepts of computation
Common misconceptions about Computer Science


✅ 6 May 2025
Reorganized and reformatted the learning-log.md file for better readability.
Structured logs using GitHub-compatible Markdown with collapsible quiz sections.
Pushed updated learning-log.md to the GitHub repo using proper Git workflow:
Staged changes with git add
Committed with a clear message using git commit
Pushed to GitHub with git push
Reviewed and internalized:
Stored-program vs fixed-program architecture
Syntax → Static Semantics → Semantics in programming languages


✅ 7 May 2025
Finished **Introduction to Biology** learning sequence  
  - Scored **8/8** on Test-Yourself questions
Created **Anki deck “Biochem Set 1”**  
  - praciced for 10 minutes
Updated `learning-log.md` with today’s fuzzy point, a-ha moment, win, and energy level


✅ 8 May 2025 – Week 1 Day 4 Summary
###  What I Did Today
- Completed **first 12 slides of Lecture 2** (MITx 6.00.1x):  
  Covered core control flow concepts: `if`, `else`, `while`
- Solved all **3 finger exercises** under the “while” section
- Deep-dived into **Problem Set 1 – Question 1**:  
  Implemented Newton’s method for approximating square roots
- Learned how to derive the Newton update rule:  
  `x = x - f(x)/f'(x)` → `guess = guess - (((guess ** 2) - a) / (2 * guess))`
- Committed and pushed a working `ps1_scratch.py` file  
- Created and pushed a fully commented **learning summary PDF** on Newton’s Method
### 🧠 What I Found Challenging
- Understanding **where `f'(x) = 2x` comes from** and how it fits into the Newton formula  
- Mentally linking **derivatives (slope)** with the visual idea of “how steep the function is”
- Staying confident during moments of doubt — felt overwhelmed asking many questions
### 📈 Points to Improve Next Time
- Try drawing rough graphs or visuals earlier to help with slope/curve intuition  
- Summarize each key concept in my own words right after learning it (in the log or comments)
- Focus on **making peace with slow understanding** — deep learning takes time and that’s okay  
- Remember: Asking many questions is not weakness, it’s the method
